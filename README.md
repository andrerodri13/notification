# Email Notification Library, use phpMailer

This library has the function of sending email using a phpmailer library. Doing this in an uncomplicated way is essential for any system.

To do a library installation, run the following command:

```sh
Composer requires gustavoweb / composer_teste
```

To make use of the library, simply require the autoload of the composer, invoke a class and make a method call:

```sh
<? php

require __DIR__. '/vendor/autoload.php';

USE Notification \ Email;

$mail = new Email (2, "mail.host.com", "your@email.com", "your-pass", "smtp secure (tls / ssl)", "port (587)", 'from@email.com", "From the Name");

$ email-> sendEmail ("SUbject", "Content", "reply@email.com", "Replay name", "address@email.com", "Address name");
```

Note that a whole setup of sending the email is using the magic builder method! Once the Builder method is invoked within your application, your system will be able to fire the shots.
